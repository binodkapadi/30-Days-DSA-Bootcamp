QUESTION ==>

-----------------------------------MOUNTAINS AND VALLEY---------------------------

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Given an array of integers, determine if it exhibits a continuous mountain and valley pattern.A continuous mountain and valley pattern means that the array elements strictly alternate between increasing and decreasing. That is:
Either a[0] < a[1] > a[2] < a[3] > a[4] ..., or
a[0] > a[1] < a[2] > a[3] < a[4] ....
Note:
If the array has only one element, return 1.

INPUT FORMAT
The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains n space-separated integers.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Print 1 if the array follows the continuous mountain and valley pattern, otherwise print 0.

CONSTRAINTS
1 <= n <= 4 *10^3
0 <=elements  <= 10^4

SAMPLE TESTCASE 0
Testcase Input
5
1 2 3 2 1
Testcase Output
0
Explanation
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
As 1 to 3 is increasing, that means values consistently do not alternate between increasing and decreasing. So the answer is 0.

SAMPLE TESTCASE 1
Testcase Input
5
1 2 1 2 1
Testcase Output
1
Explanation
1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1
As values consistently alternate between increasing and decreasing. So the answer is 1
